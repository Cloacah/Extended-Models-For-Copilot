# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented here.

## [0.1.6] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Remove Reasoning Effort from model picker tooltip/quick controls to avoid UI-value and persisted-config mismatch.
- Accept more Copilot model-picker configuration field shapes (`reasoningEffort`, `reasoning_effort`, `thinkingEffort`, numeric/string temperature) before persisting quick settings.
- Show installed built-in language models in the vision proxy dropdown even when the stable VS Code API does not expose `imageInput` capability metadata.
- Allow an explicitly selected built-in model to be used as the vision proxy instead of filtering it out due to missing non-public capability metadata.

## [0.1.5] - 2026-04-30

### Fixed

- Stop marking every non-vision model as image-capable in the Copilot model list; only native vision models or models with an explicit model-level vision proxy advertise image input.
- Persist model picker quick configuration changes for reasoning effort and temperature back to `extendedModels.models` when a request is made.
- Replace manual vision proxy model ID inputs with dropdowns populated from native vision presets and installed image-capable Copilot models.
- Restore DeepSeek v4 presets to the 1,048,576 token context window and document model preset source links for future updates.

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Rename the extension UI to Copilot Bro while keeping the existing `extendedModels` configuration namespace for compatibility.
- Add a visible VS Code Settings entry and command for opening the model configuration page directly.
- Add global and per-model vision proxy settings so text-only models can use an image-capable model, including built-in Copilot models, to describe image attachments.
- Add Z.AI vision presets for `glm-5v-turbo`, `glm-4.6v`, and `glm-4.5v`.
- Add model picker quick configuration metadata for reasoning effort and temperature with stable text fallback.
- Add Markdown prompt presets using `*.copilot-bro.prompt.md`, including built-in presets and workspace/global discovery.

### Changed

- Improve configuration page button styling with VS Code theme colors.
- Apply Kimi thinking requests with `keep: "all"` and keep MiniMax `reasoning_split` enabled for separated reasoning streams.
- Improve cross-model history handling by replaying reasoning where required and stripping or trimming provider-private history where it is unsafe.
- Update README screenshots, usage docs, keywords, and install command for Copilot Bro.

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Add MiniMax OpenAI-compatible presets for M2.7, M2.5, M2.1, and M2 with `reasoning_split` enabled for separated reasoning streams.
- Add an Extended Models status-bar token usage estimate because VS Code/Copilot currently reports `0%` native context usage for third-party language model providers.
- Add custom-model UI fields for temperature, top-p, thinking, and reasoning effort.

### Fixed

- Preserve the configuration page's current provider/model selection and scroll position when saving local model overrides.
- Improve token estimation for visible chat content by stripping hidden reasoning metadata before counting and by consuming provider usage chunks when available.
- Strengthen model picker tooltip/detail text with context, output, vision, tools, thinking, temperature, and reasoning-effort metadata while staying on stable VS Code APIs.
- Narrow DeepSeek reasoning-effort choices to the actually meaningful `high` and `max` options, and keep unsupported providers from advertising fake effort choices in built-in hints.

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Persist DeepSeek reasoning in a fingerprint-based cache and restore it for prior assistant turns, matching native DeepSeek provider behavior across multi-turn Agent workflows.
- Restore reasoning for non-tool assistant turns when a DeepSeek conversation contains tool history, avoiding second-turn `reasoning_content` API failures.
- Improve token counting for serialized VS Code chat text parts so Copilot's context usage and compaction decisions receive realistic counts.

### Added

- Add additional Zhipu / Z.AI built-in presets including GLM 4.6, GLM 4.5, GLM 4 Plus, GLM 4 Air, and GLM 4 Flash.

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-29

### Fixed

- Replay DeepSeek `reasoning_content` only for assistant messages that produced tool calls, matching DeepSeek thinking-mode requirements and preventing multi-turn `400 Bad Request` failures.
- Preserve full DeepSeek assistant tool-call messages in memory and repair later Agent history when VS Code stable APIs omit the hidden reasoning/tool-call pairing.
- Drop unrecoverable orphan tool results in DeepSeek thinking mode instead of sending invalid history that the provider rejects.
- Preserve DeepSeek tool-call reasoning through chat-history metadata and rendered thinking blocks on the stable VS Code API path, keeping thinking enabled while restoring the required `reasoning_content` on later Agent turns.
- Read `reasoning_content` from both streamed `delta` chunks and final `choice.message` tool-call chunks, fixing providers that only attach reasoning to the completed assistant message.
- Normalize VS Code/Copilot's `__vscode-...` tool-call ID suffixes before replaying DeepSeek history, so cached reasoning matches later tool results.
- Recover reasoning attached directly to VS Code tool-call parts when present in Copilot chat diagnostics.
- Drop unrecoverable DeepSeek assistant tool-call turns when the true `reasoning_content` is unavailable, instead of sending placeholder reasoning that DeepSeek still rejects.
- Render reasoning as collapsible chat thinking blocks when the stable API path is used, while stripping those blocks before provider replay so they do not become normal assistant content.
- Increase DeepSeek v4 default output budget from 8K to 32K tokens and expose the official larger range, because thinking tokens and final answer tokens share the same output budget.
- Report a practical 200K context window for DeepSeek v4 presets so VS Code's context usage indicator is useful instead of staying at 0% for normal chats.
- Keep DeepSeek reasoning replay metadata out of visible chat output.
- Return immediately after streamed tool-call completion instead of waiting for `[DONE]`, preventing Agent mode timeouts on OpenAI-compatible providers that hold the stream open.
- Use OpenAI-compatible `tool_choice: "required"` for required multi-tool Agent requests, improving tool invocation reliability beyond single-tool cases.
- Treat `requestTimeoutMs` as connection/stream idle timeout instead of total request lifetime, so long but actively streaming complex responses are not aborted at 120 seconds.
- Race provider fetch/stream reads against the timeout explicitly, so timeouts work even when a runtime does not interrupt `ReadableStream.read()` after abort.
- Removed dependency on VS Code proposed APIs so the extension can run after ordinary VSIX / Marketplace installation on VS Code 1.104+.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-28

### Added

- Initial VS Code language model provider for Copilot Chat.
- OpenAI-compatible `/chat/completions` streaming support.
- Built-in model presets for DeepSeek, Zhipu / Z.AI, Kimi / Moonshot, and Qwen / DashScope.
- Tool calling support for Agent workflows.
- Vision input support for compatible models.
- Thinking and reasoning stream support for `reasoning_content`, `reasoning`, `thinking`, and XML `<think>` blocks.
- Visual configuration page with local model overrides and custom provider/model creation.
- Local-only API key storage through VS Code `SecretStorage`.
- Sensitive setting filtering and redacted diagnostics.
- Automatic VSIX packaging script.
- GitHub Release upload script via GitHub CLI.

### Security

- API keys are never written to `settings.json`, exported model configuration, README examples, or logs.
- Sensitive fields such as `Authorization`, `apiKey`, `api_key`, `token`, `secret`, `password`, and `cookie` are filtered from model settings and exports.
